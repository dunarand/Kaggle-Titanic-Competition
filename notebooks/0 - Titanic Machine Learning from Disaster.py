# ## Introduction <a name="1"></a>
#
# Titanic is one of the most widely-known deadly incidents of history.
#
# > RMS Titanic was a British ocean linear that sank in the early hours of
# 15 April 1912 as a result of striking an icebern on her maiden voyage from
# Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224
# passengers and crew aboard, approximately 1,500 died (estimates vary), making
# the incident one of the deadliest peacetime sinkings of a single ship.
# > (Wikipedia contributors, 2025)
#
# The Kaggle competition page states the challange as follows:
#
# > On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered
# “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately,
# there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death
# of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
# >
# > While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some
# groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
# >
# > In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the
# question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger
# data (i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
